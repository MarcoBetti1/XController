# Architecture Notes

## Design Intent

The package is structured around one stateful adapter that owns:

- Playwright startup and shutdown
- browser/profile recovery
- shared DOM interaction helpers
- X-specific navigation and action flows
- login-state detection and media capture

The DOM selector surface and soft-failure diagnostics are now split into dedicated internal modules so the adapter remains the orchestrator instead of also being the source of truth for every selector and diagnostic type.

The library favors click-driven navigation first and uses direct URL navigation as a recovery path.

`main` intentionally contains only the reusable controller package. Lab UI, lab API, and test harness files belong on `labui-testing`.

## Current Main-Branch Modules

- `adapter.py`
  Main controller implementation and X-specific flow logic.
- `sync.py`
  Synchronous facade that owns an event-loop thread and forwards stable service APIs.
- `_ui_selectors.py`
  Centralized selector and UI rule tables for X-specific DOM matching.
- `_diagnostics.py`
  `ActionFailureInfo` and `UIActionError` used to surface soft UI failures.
- `base.py`
  Shared adapter contract, observed data models, detailed action results, preflight results, timeline read results, and health/media diagnostics.
- `settings.py`
  Runtime knobs for browser size, typing cadence, pauses, and user-agent defaults.
- `human.py`
  Helper methods for jitter, typing cadence, mouse movement, and network-idle waits.

## Adapter Organization

Inside `XController`, methods now fall into clearer buckets:

- startup/shutdown
- sync fallback helpers
- low-level DOM helpers
- navigation helpers
- post collection/parsing helpers
- public read/write actions

The current maintenance boundary is:

- `_ui_selectors.py`
  Selector drift and X wording changes.
- `adapter.py`
  Flow orchestration, retries, state transitions, detailed service APIs, browser snapshots, passive login state, and post media capture.
- `sync.py`
  Synchronous caller contract only. It should not duplicate DOM selectors or browser flow logic.
- `_diagnostics.py`
  Soft-failure recording and strict-mode escalation.

## Service Integration APIs

Long-running service callers should prefer:

- `preflight_action()`
  Check reply, quote, or like feasibility before spending generation or media work.
- `*_detailed()`
  Capture stable failure stages and reasons for write actions while preserving legacy compact methods.
- `read_timeline_detailed()`
  Report requested tab, active tab, URL, article count, and warnings for home timeline reads.
- `SyncXController`
  Call the same service APIs from synchronous runtimes without a downstream event-loop bridge.
- `login_state()`
  Get passive login/session status without importing selector internals.
- `capture_post_media()`
  Capture local post media artifacts for downstream media analysis.
- `settle_after_action()`
  Settle back to a requested home tab after write/action flows when a service needs a known surface.
- `debug_snapshot()` and `health_check()`
  Capture current browser state without forcing downstream wrappers to duplicate selector probes.

The main cleanup rule applied here was: keep the public behavior stable, but consolidate duplicate internal logic where possible.

## Compatibility Choices

- `XController` remains an alias of `XTextAdapter`.
- `reply_to_post()` is the only public reply method name.
- `return_home(force_refresh=False)` is the single public home-recovery entrypoint.
- Image-capable post, reply, and quote methods accept `image_paths`; image-only wrappers are deprecated compatibility helpers.
- Detailed action methods report their observed final surface, but callers that require a known feed surface should call `settle_after_action()`.

## Branch Separation

- `main`
  Releasable controller code and docs only.
- `labui-testing`
  Streamlit/FastAPI tooling, manual walkthrough utilities, and automated tests.

Core fixes may be developed on `labui-testing`, but they should be merged back into `main` selectively so `main` stays consumable by the downstream project.

## Packaging

This repository uses a flat package layout where the package root is the project root itself.

`pyproject.toml` now explicitly maps the package name `XController` to `.` so editable installs and wheels do not depend on implicit setuptools discovery.

## Recommended Next Steps

- Split non-X-specific browser helpers into a reusable internal module if another platform adapter is added.
- Keep automated tests on `labui-testing`, or add a small core-only test set back to `main` if the downstream integration path needs it.
- Keep the runtime smoke tests in `main`; they now cover sync lifecycle behavior and soft-failure diagnostics without launching a real browser.
- Introduce semantic version tags once the API is stable enough for third-party consumers.
